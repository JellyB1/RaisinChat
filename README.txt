# Welcome to Raisin Chat

I am starting my path down web development. I've spent some time learning about HTML and CSS, but lets face it, those two alone make for a super lame webpage. That is where my JS adventures begin. I am the type of person who learns better by applying what I am learning; it really helps me draw connections between concepts and real life applications. 

While the name isn't too intuitive or exciting, I would like to introduce you to my first attempt at a chat room.
