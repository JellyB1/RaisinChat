Welcome to Raisin Chat

I am starting my path down web development. I've spent some time learning about HTML and CSS, but lets face it, those two alone make for a super lame webpage. That is where my JS adventures begin. I am the type of person who learns better by applying what I am learning; it really helps me draw connections between concepts and real life applications. 

While the name isn't too intuitive or exciting, I would like to introduce you to my first attempt at a chat room. I used Node.js and Socket.io to implement functionality into this project.

Currently, this chat room is only usable on local networks, and nothing is saved to the server (once you leave the page, you lose all messages). 

As I continue to learn, I plan to update and implement:
    
    - Hosting the site using a cloud service, which will allow for more than one person to connect to the server from external networks (so you can chat with your friend in a different city!)

    - Save previous messages, so a newcomer will be able to catch up and view previous messages

    - Create a login page/user accounts

I appreciate the time you took to read this file, and any recommendations for improvement would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you!

Angelica
